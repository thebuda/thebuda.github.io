Just a quick project to organize all of my network components.  This is a common problem I see with a lot of people.  By the time you've got your modem and router, things are already getting messy.  Add in another switch, maybe a VOIP, and then start playing with SBC's and things get ugly fast.  Further you wind up with a rats' nest of cables.  It seems most people have a self or drawer of bundles of wires and network gear.

To solve this I move everything to the basement.  I have a lot of useless space under the stairs. Using heavy duty velcro I mounting all my stuff so I could see it and easily reset/reconfigure as needed.
