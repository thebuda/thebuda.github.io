# Cowboy Caviar

## Ingredients[^1]

- 1x 15oz can black-eyed peas (drained)
- 1x 11oz can of corn (drained)
- 2x avocados (diced)
- 1/2 cup diced tomato
- 2/3 cup red onion (diced)
- 2/3 cup fresh cilantro (chopped)
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 2 clove garlic (minced)
- 1 tsp ground cumin

[^1]: Recipe is extremely forgiving of substitutions.  We often swap black beans for the black-eyed peas, frozen corn for the canned, and in winter we use a 2 Tbsp dried cilantro instead of fresh.

## Instructions

1. Combine all ingredients and mix.
2. Let sit several hours, stirring occasionally, before serving with tortilla chips. 24 hrs is even better
