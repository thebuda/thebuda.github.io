# Welcome

Welcome to my new streamlined website.  The focus is on simple, easy to read, easy to print informative posts.  If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me on the contact page.

## Sections

- [Recipes](/recipes.html) - My collection of proven recipes.  This is where *I go* to pull up my old stand-bys.
- [Projects and Experiments](/projects.html) - My posts of things I have built, snippets of useful code, things I've tried.  Sometimes I just don't want to forget, even the failures can be helpful later.
- [Ukulele Stuff](/ukulele.html) - I've been playing the ukulele on and off since 2014, and I've started to write my own tabs when what I find online isn't quite right.  I try to make them as easy to read PDFs you can view on-screen or download and print.  These will also work for the guitar as well, although I adjusted the key of a few songs for ease of play.
- [Miscellaneous](/other.html) - Other cats and dogs that don't quite fit in the other bins.
- [About](/about.html) - About this page, about me, and my contact information.
