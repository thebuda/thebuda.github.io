## About this section

I *hate* when recipe sites make you read through 5 pages of sloppy writing, long boring narratives about the invention of this or that sub par dish they "invented."  THis cookbook is just a simple text collection of he recipes that work for me. I wanted something I could look at print easily and share.  Maybe you'll find some use here too.
