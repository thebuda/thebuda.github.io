## About this site

I've been making websites on and off for over 20 years.  I started at [Angelfire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelfire) when they opened in 1996, then moved to [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) for a few years before settling at Fuitadnet for a while.  Then I jumped to [ipage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPage) for 5-6 years running a Wordpress blog. For the last few years, I was at [Blogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)) because it was easy and free. 

*"Thanks for the worthless history lesson Buda, but, who cares?*

Fair point, but the reason I say all of that is I've been around the block and having wasted a lot of time chasing after the next thing, I wanted to get back to basics.  I've moved over to Github Pages because a) it's free, b) open to all sorts of hand-coding options, c) lets me share my code with you if your interested (you can see everything at [https://github.com/thebuda/thebuda.github.io](https://github.com/thebuda/thebuda.github.io), and d) is helping me learn more and more.

So What are my goals for this website?  Well, here's what I wrote down when I started.

1) It needs to be a site I can use to collect my own notes and information to refer back to.  If I make a Ukulele Tab and want to open it up on my phone, I should be able to use my own site.  Same thing for recipes or snippets of code.

2) I *hate* when recipe sites make you read through 5 pages of sloppy writing, long boring narratives about the invention of this or that sub-par dish they "whipped."  A good recipe site should be fast, easy to read, easy to print.

3) While I'd love to have crazy cash rolling in, I'm not a blogger, and this isn't my job.  It's a hobby, and I need to acknowledge that. While I may link to occasional products, it's going to be because it eases the understanding of the reader, not because I want to make money.
